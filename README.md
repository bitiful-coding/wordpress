Learn wordpress coding step by step
Before starting coding, it's recommended to upload ready-to-download data to your wordpress website, instead of creating posts and comments manually to test your website.
First go to this website https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test and download this xml file "themeunittestdata.wordpress.xml", then:

1. Import test data into your WordPress install by going to Tools => Import => WordPress
2. Select the XML file from your computer
3.Click on "Upload file and import".
4. Under "Import Attachments," check the "Download and import file attachments" box and click submit.
Note: you may have to repeat the Import step until you see "All Done" to obtain the full list of Posts and Media.
